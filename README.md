🚀 **Project Alert: Mobile Profile UI with ChatGPT + Web Tech**
📱 Built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Thrilled to share a new UI component I built — a **Profile Dashboard Interface** inspired by modern mobile app design! 💡

This project was designed and developed with the help of **ChatGPT**, which helped streamline the HTML/CSS structure, improve UI responsiveness, and speed up the process. ⚡

🎨 Features:

* Clean profile section with avatar and user role
* Intuitive navigation with icons and section dividers
* Bottom tab bar for seamless access
* Fully responsive layout with sleek styling

🛠️ Technologies Used:

* HTML (structure)
* CSS (styling and layout)
* JavaScript (for future interactivity)
* ChatGPT (AI-powered development assistant)

This is a great example of how **AI tools can accelerate front-end development** — from concept to code.

👉 Would love your thoughts and feedback!
